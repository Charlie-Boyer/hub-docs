# Single Sign-On (SSO)

<Tip warning={true}>
This feature is part of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/enterprise">Enterprise Hub</a>.
</Tip>

Single sign-on (SSO) allows organizations to securely manage user authentication through their own identity provider (IdP). Both SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols are supported.

Please note that SSO on Hugging Face is designed for managing access to organization-specific resources (like private models, datasets, and Spaces) and does not replace the core authentication for the Hugging Face platform itself.

This feature allows organizations to:

- Enforce mandatory authentication through your company's IdP
- Automatically manage user access and roles based on your IdP attributes
- Support popular providers like Okta, OneLogin, and Azure Active Directory
- Maintain security while allowing external collaborators when needed
- Control session timeouts and role mappings

<Tip>
User provisioning (e.g., via SCIM) is supported as part of the Enterprise Plus plan. Please contact your Hugging Face account team or [reach out to sales](https://huggingface.co/contact/sales?from=docs-hub-enterprise-sso) for more information.
